Conway's Game of Life
By Andrew Buntine.

ABOUT

Implemented in PLT Scheme and viewport over the course of a few warm
Melbourne evenings, early 2010.

The Game of Life, also known simply as Life, is a cellular automaton
devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970. It is
the best-known example of a cellular automaton.

The "game" is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined
by its initial state, requiring no further input from humans. One
interacts with the Game of Life by creating an initial configuration
and observing how it evolves.

My implementation accepts:
 - cells: Number of cells per row
 - rows: Number of rows
 - seed: An initial pattern (a seed) as a list consisting
         of a set of sublists, each containing a cell x and
         a row y.


USAGE

  (load "gol.scm")

  ; A three-cell oscillator.
  (gol 20 20 '((10 10) (11 10) (12 10)))

Press ESC key to exit during the game.

I've supplied several interesting seed patterns in "patterns.scm" that you
can use. For example:

  (load "patterns.scm")
  (gol 50 50 koks-galaxy)


TODO

 - Experiment with drawing to a pixmap and then copying to viewport.
 - Write (more) domain-specific wrappers for common procedures.
